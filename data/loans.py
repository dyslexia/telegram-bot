    "1. Loan origination fee\n"
    "2. Loan retention premium fee schedule\n"
    "3. Principal repayment condition/maximum loan duration\n"

    "The lending process delegates the loan terms to standalone smart contracts (see whitepaper below for "
    "more details). These loan terms contracts must be deployed, and then “added” or “removed” from the "
    "Lending Pool as “available” loan terms for new loans. The DAO will be able to add or remove these term "
    "contracts.\n\nLoan term contracts may be created by any interested third party, enabling a market "
    "process by which new loan terms may be invented, provided they implement the proper interface."
